# Shader Art

## Update 12/19/19
I've created a whole new React-based viewer for these shaders. The links below will now take you to the code for each project.

* 12/29/19 - [Icosphere Explode](https://github.com/captainpainway/shader-art/tree/master/docs/threejs-icosphere-explode): Experimenting with vertex and fragment shaders in Three.js. Click and drag the mouse to explode the icosphere.
* 8/1/18 - [Random Lines](https://github.com/captainpainway/shader-art/tree/master/docs/glsl-random-lines): Random lines.
* 7/30/18 - [Bumpy Sphere](https://github.com/captainpainway/shader-art/tree/master/docs/glsl-bumpy-sphere): Signed distance function ray marching. Time-based displacement and rotation with phong shading.
* 7/29/18 - [Spinning Color Wheel](https://github.com/captainpainway/shader-art/tree/master/docs/glsl-spinning-color-wheel): HSB color wheel, masked into a 2D donut, with time-based rotation.
* 7/27/18 - [Very Basic](https://github.com/captainpainway/shader-art/tree/master/docs/glsl-very-basic): Basic half-screen linear gradients.
* 7/24/18 - [Just A Cube](https://github.com/captainpainway/shader-art/tree/master/docs/glsl-just-a-cube): Just a cube.
* 7/22/18 - [Julia Fractal](https://github.com/captainpainway/shader-art/tree/master/docs/glsl-juliafractal): A time-based Julia fractal based off the Mandelbrot fractal.
* 7/21/18 - [Mandelbrot](https://github.com/captainpainway/shader-art/tree/master/docs/glsl-mandelbrot): A simple Mandelbrot fractal.
* 7/20/18 - [A-Chain](https://github.com/captainpainway/shader-art/tree/master/docs/glsl-a-chain): An experiment in using GLSL shaders with A-Frame/three.js.
* 7/18/18 - [Squishy Donut Spin](https://github.com/captainpainway/shader-art/tree/master/docs/glsl-squishydonutspin): Ray marching with signed distance functions. Twisting and rotating a primitive based on time.
* 7/16/18 - [Kaleidoscope](https://github.com/captainpainway/shader-art/tree/master/docs/glsl-kaleidoscope): Time-based constructive solid geometry and shading.
* 7/15/18 - [Cubes](https://github.com/captainpainway/shader-art/tree/master/docs/glsl-cubes): Experimenting with ray marching, signed distance functions, phong shading, repetition, and camera movement.
